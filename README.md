A clummsy mimic of Andrej Karpathy's tutorial on [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd). I choose Typescript because I want to learn the language.

All code is hand written. Because I want myself to learn, also because I just spent an entire day trying to get AI to produce runnable code. I'm not familiar with Nextjs, so I feel like a monkey  press random keys to make things work. Although it sort of worked in the end, it's ugly and painful, and I'm exausted and sad.

I then watched Andrej's tutorial, I feel like I gained new understanding, and that makes me happy. That is why I made this repo. I'm happy while doing so.
